# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Using my understanding of what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce my dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA I have created an analysis for my clients (Accountability Accounting) who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Accountability Accounting is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers and have tasked me with creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Results
### Elbow Curve
The Elbow Curve shoes a k value of 4.  I will use 4 clusters to group the crytpocurrencies.
